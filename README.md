# Etch-a-Sketch (Odin Project)

This project is part of **The Odin Project Foundations Path**.

## 📌 What it does
- Creates a **16x16 grid of square divs** using **JavaScript**.
- Squares change color when hovered, leaving a pixelated trail.
- Includes a **button** that lets you pick a new grid size (up to 100 squares per side).

## 🎯 What I practiced
- Using **JavaScript** to dynamically create elements.
- Using **Flexbox** to arrange divs into a grid.
- Handling **hover effects** and **event listeners** in JavaScript.
- Working with **prompts** and **buttons**.

## 🚀 Features
- Default 16x16 grid.
- Hover effect to color squares.
- Button to reset grid size (user input).

## 📝 Extra credit (optional ideas)
- Randomize square colors on hover.
- Darken squares by 10% with each hover until fully black.
